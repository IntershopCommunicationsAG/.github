== Development process
The development process follows the very simplified GitFlow process:

[#FeatureDev]
=== Develop a feature

. create a new branch on `master`-branch named like your feature
. apply all your changes to that branch
. use link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[conventional commits] referencing your ticket id if there's such a ticket
. create a PR into the `master`-branch

[#HotfixDev]
=== Develop a hotfix
Follow the same process as xref:FeatureDev[developing a feature].

[#ReleaseCreation]
=== Create a release
. create a Git tag inside the `master`-branch pointing to the commit to be released
. the name of the tag has to follow the link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] pattern `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (the tag's name is directly used as the release version).

[NOTE]
====
The `master`-branch may also be named `main`.
