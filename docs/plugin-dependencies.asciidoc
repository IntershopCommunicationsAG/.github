[IMPORTANT]
The dependencies that are marked [.red]#red# are implementation dependencies onto plugins: code of a plugin is referenced instead or additionally to using it as a plugin. This often leads to version conflicts when using the dependent plugin.

When releasing all or some of these plugins / libraries the dependencies enforce a certain order:

1.
----
rest-test-client
test-gradle-plugin
semantic-version

javacc-gradle-plugin
